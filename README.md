# Characterization and Evaluation of Hardware Accelerators

This is the code that I used for the measurements I did with the USB Accelerator Module with Tensor Processing Unit and the Neural Compute Stick 2 with Vision Processing Unit.

Here, I used different benchmark neural network models using TensorFlow Python API to investigate the computing architecture of these hardware. For more information, please refer to the PDF files `Defense_Limodya.pdf` and `Thesis_Limodya.pdf`.
